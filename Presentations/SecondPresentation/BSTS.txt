In order to better capture the day-by-day flow, we decided to implement a Bayesian Structural Time Series. In this framework there are two essential ingredients: a stochastically evolving vector denoting the state at time t and the output which is a transformation of the state plus an error. Here the state is given by a one step autoregressive mean plus an also autoregressive slope and a peridic component, averaging over an entire week. Finally, the output is the number of travels per day. The results are not encouraging, since the output error seems to dominate the entire model. In order to overcome this difficulty, we tried to implement in JAGS our personal version of the BSTS adding a linear regression factor to the output, considering rain and temperature - which appeared important from a frequentist viewpoint -, and a local autoregressive component to the state, together with suitable uninformative priors. In particular, to make a more robust estimate for a possible future week, we added a stronger autoregression on mean and slope, taking into account the analogous values for two past weeks. Finally, considering the small amount of data and the high number of parameters to be estimated, we decided to make an attemptive unorthodox correction to the priors of the variances, blocking their maximum value to the scale factor estimated by the Poisson model, thus reducing dramatically the variability of the terms. Results under this correction are forced to be more similar to the data and give better performances in terms of prediction. Just a negative aspect: forecefully underestimating variances to have better average predictions, we slightly lose interpretabliy of the state components, which tend to mix a bit in an attempt to overcome the local inaccuracy. Under these conditions, also the linear regression becomes more and interpretable and valuable [values of waic].  Under the same conditions, a generalization to time zones is available and performs adequately.
